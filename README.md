## Week 3 Homework Assignment: Introduction to Databases with SQLite

### Loading Dataset
I loaded two different datasets; one from Stony Brook Hospital and St Joseph CHS from github
I imported pandas and numpy to start my exploratory data analysis
I filled in missing values with unknown for categorical columns and with 0 for numerical columns for both datasets
I claned white spaces and special charactors from both datasets
I obtained frequency counts of categorical columns for both datasets
I then obtained descriptive statistics of all numerical columns such as std, mean and variacne etc..
